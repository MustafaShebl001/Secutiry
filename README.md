# Secutiry
Using pyCryptodome to implement encryption and decryption using different encryption standards (AES), also integrating it RSA with hashing SHA512 to implement digital signature and verification beside producing certificates
This project provides a GUI with different buttons and functionality:
2 buttons for ENC/DEC in AES256.
2 buttons for ENC/DEC in Triple DES (key size 16 bytes).
2 buttons for SIGN/VERIFY in RSA2048.
2 buttons for ENC-SIGN/DEC-VERIFY.
one button for RSA Key pair generation.
one button for self-signed Certificate.
one button for verifying the Certificate.

You can specify the file you want to operate on by clicking the button then selecting the file path.
